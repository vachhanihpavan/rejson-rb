# RedisJSON Ruby Client [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/vachhanihpavan/rejson-rb.svg?token=x85KXUqPs5qJik1EzpyW&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/vachhanihpavan/rejson-rb)

rejson-rb is a package that allows storing, updating and querying objects as JSON documents in a [Redis](https://redis.io/) database that is extended with the [ReJSON](https://github.com/RedisJSON/RedisJSON) module. The package extends redis-rb's interface with ReJSON's API, and performs on-the-fly serialization/deserialization of objects to/from JSON.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rejson-rb'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rejson-rb
